# Test Flow Outline

## 1. User Starts a Test:
   - The user selects an exam type and difficulty level.
   - Clicks on a "Start Test" button.

## 2. Backend Generates Test Information:
   - Backend receives the request to start a test.
   - Generates a unique test ID.
   - Retrieves relevant details for the test (questions, duration, etc.) from the database.

## 3. Backend Sends Test Information to Frontend:
   - Sends the test details (questions, duration, etc.) to the frontend.
   - Frontend stores this information in its state.

## 4. Frontend Displays Test Instructions:
   - Displays test instructions, including the rules and guidelines.

## 5. User Starts Test Timer:
   - Frontend starts a countdown timer based on the test duration.

## 6. User Answers Questions:
   - Iterates through each question.
   - Displays the question and options.
   - User selects answers.
   - Frontend stores user answers in its state.

## 7. User Submits Test:
   - User completes answering all questions.
   - Clicks on a "Submit Test" button.

## 8. Frontend Validates and Prepares Test Data:
   - Frontend validates that all questions are answered.
   - Prepares test data, including user answers and test details.

## 9. Frontend Sends Test Data to Backend:
   - Sends the test data (test ID, user ID, user answers, etc.) to the backend.

## 10. Backend Evaluates Test:
    - Receives the test data from the frontend.
    - Evaluates each question:
        - Compares user answers with correct answers.
        - Calculates scores.
        - Determines correctness and updates the test results in the database.

## 11. Backend Sends Test Results to Frontend:
    - Sends the test results (scores, correctness) to the frontend.

## 12. Frontend Displays Test Results:
    - Displays the user's overall score.
    - Shows correctness for each question.

## 13. Test Ends:
    - Test session concludes.
    - User can view results and navigate to other sections.

# Important Coding Aspects:

- **State Management (Frontend):**
  - Use React state to manage test-related information (questions, user answers, timer, etc.).

- **API Endpoints (Backend):**
  - Create Express.js routes for handling test-related actions (start test, submit test, get test details, etc.).

- **Database Operations (Backend):**
  - Implement database queries to retrieve test details and update test results.

- **Timer Implementation (Frontend):**
  - Use JavaScript `setTimeout` or a library for handling the test timer.

- **Validation (Frontend and Backend):**
  - Implement validation to ensure that the user answers all questions before submitting the test.

- **Communication (Frontend-Backend Interaction):**
  - Use AJAX, Axios, or Fetch API to facilitate communication between the frontend and backend.

- **Error Handling (Frontend and Backend):**
  - Implement error handling to manage potential issues during the test flow.

- **Scalability Considerations:**
  - Design the system to handle multiple users taking tests simultaneously.
